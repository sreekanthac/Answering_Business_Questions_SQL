The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop such as data about the artists, songs, playlists, music genres and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases.\n",

    "Just as a curiosity, the database's name is inspired in another database, the Northwind database. According to its creator, the Chinook database is named after the winds in the interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges. The Chinooks are most common over southern Alberta in Canada and that is why he thought it would be I good name for a database that intented to be an alternative to Northwind.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all information that Chinook contains, there is an infinity of answers we could get out of this database. Therefore, the main goal of this project, is to write some queries to demonstrate some of the insights we can get from the data and how they could be applied to the real world.\n",

    "The goal of this project was to answer some important business questions using SQL that would help the company in making necessary changes in their future investment plans. We were able to do that successfully and also get insight on some other topics as well. We were able to understand the customer preferences and how much the company stocks are matching against those demands. We were also able to identify the potential markets where company can focus. We also identified one area where company probably could save money that is by purchasing tracks separately from the recorders than the whole album.  \n",
